<em>Some writing ideas for the future</em>
<ul>
  <li>My dad ran a BBS from our home in the 1990s to support our family </li>
  <li>My mom played Oil's Well on the Commodore 64 while I sat on her lap as a newborn</li>
  <li>The Toronto Science Centre had Sun workstations with access to the internet via a T1, with a 3 button laser mice long before they were consumer products </li>
  <li>I learned "object oriented programming" from an old MS-DOS, ANSI based video game called ZZT. There's a whole genre of these kinds of games worth exploring (Kroz, Megazeux, Insanity) </li>
  <li>How Sierra and Apogee games had an outsized effect on me</li>
  <li>How our cable company used to broadcast analog radio over coax, and how nobody I've ever spoken to knew that was a thing</li>
  <li>Some mildly impressive stories about "DXing" ($20 term for "getting radio signals from far away")</li>
  <li>The time I wrote a script to prove that our cable modem woes were related to UHF ingress from a local TV transmitter</li>
  <li>What it's like to cross the Canada-US border by bicycle</li>
  <li>The time I almost died due to a miswired outlet (which, funny enough, also relates to the radio-over-coax story)</li>
</ul>
